I made a scene of a busy city with multiple buildings placed close together to make it feel crowded.
What I implemented –
I used NavMesh and Raycast for player movement using the mouse pointer. The player has running, idle, and jump animations. I also used a different animation layer with an Animator Mask and an IK Grab script to pick items up — the attraction object is the item on the ground, which is assigned during the pickup animation using GetComponent<>(), so the hand moves toward it naturally. (You can pick up items using the Right Mouse Button when near it.) To transition between the animation layers, I used a coroutine to make it look like the player is actually crouching while picking up items.
For the jump movement, I used a coroutine with a parabolic arc between NavMesh link start and end positions so it looks like the character is really jumping instead of just playing an animation. The player can switch weapons using the 1 and 2 keys after picking them up, and the weapons follow all animations like jumping and running.
I also added a cinematic camera animation using a spline when the player jumps to another building or picks up an item.
For the enemy, I used two waypoints for patrolling. If the player is within range, the enemy starts chasing and does the attack animation when OnTriggerEnter is called. Since I didn’t have proper zombie animations, I used RPGHero animations and blended them with an Animation Mask to make custom zombie-like attack, run, and walk animations. I used coroutines again here to make smooth transitions between walking and running.
